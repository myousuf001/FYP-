Title: Exploratory Analysis of Bank Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Using Python and R

This project aims to analyse customer data from a Portuguese banking institution to understand the factors influencing a clientâ€™s decision to subscribe to a term deposit. Initially planned with Python and SQL for exploratory analysis and visualisation, the approach has evolved to incorporate R for machine learning implementation and predictive modelling. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modelling in Python, followed by full-fledged machine learning implementation in R. The findings will provide insights into the effectiveness of bank marketing campaigns and suggest improvements for future strategies.
